## Mentoring Tips
* **Do a workshopper**: Make sure you have done at least **learnyounode** so you can help others
* **Hover**: Mentors float around the event asking attendees if they are stuck, or if the attendees are too scared to ask for help then the mentors would try to peak over their shoulders and give them unsolicited advice.
* **Troubleshooting** : Don't give answers straight away if you know the bug or problem they are trying to solve. Instead guide them through the debugging process as this helps:
  1. Make the learner feel less incompetent and more like we're in this together because we both don't know what's going on, and 
  2. Give them the skills to find their own bugs when there aren't mentors around.
* And read through this thorough guide from the San Francisco chapter: https://github.com/nodeschool/sanfrancisco/wiki/Mentorship-Guidelines-and-Advice
* **Organizing attendees**: Based on previous feedback, attendees would feel comfortable and can potentially perform better if grouped together with people doing the same workshoppers. If we can, setting up tables in a triangle has worked very well in the past. We will have a show of hands of which attendees will be doing what and we will do a seating shuffle at that point.
